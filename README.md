# Draw It, Or Lose It!
Operating Systems course for a game called Draw It, Or Lose It!

## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

---

Before the design of the new system for "Draw It, Or Lose It!", The Gaming Room previously had this game available for Android devices where the game involves a way to use a bunch of different images into a sort of collage to "draw" a picture on the screen where users can guess what is being drawn. The Gaming Room did not have any experience with developing this game to be distributed on the web. My job was to create this application for all users to be able to access and play this game on the web with the correct amount of security and data management so that players will have a pleasant gaming experience.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

---

I extensively researched and ensured I had the correct information that I needed to give my client the best possible resources to make the game secure for the client and it's users, run well on different operating platforms, and ensure that data usage was optimized to meet the requirements specified by the organization. I have given much thought into what we could do to help the company transfer from their old styles to the new ones with ease and profound guidance as well.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

---

I have found that understanding the differences between operating systems helps me to optimized my personal performance as a developer who can identify the resources and tools provided by the operating system that can help me achieve the right amount of security, data management, speed optimization, and hardware specificities that are needed to run the application.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

---

The one part of my document I would change would have to be the requirements and system architectures portions. I would improve the systems architecture by providing more abstract and reusable code that we may be able to take and use in another application further down the road. The requirements portion I would want to further deduce what other requirments we could use to pin down what is 100% needed for the game to run optimally.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

---

Intrepreting the user's needs involves understanding what the user may want to achieve with the game, in this particular case it involves typing a phrase, word, or thing and other users are to guess the phrase, word, or thing. Users may want many different things when playing the game. There are many possibilities, and I think that by understanding that users may want many features we may need to think about how to make the system modular and make it so that we can add more later as we recieve feedback. This would be why considering user's needs is important; because we never know everything a user might want to achieve. So we considered the main factors first - scores, user accounts, and how many games that they've won or lost.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

---

I approached designing the software from a modular approach. Understanding that we can create entities and have different classes used to encapsulate related data helps to ensure that the system works together to create the game we see before us. There are many techniques and strategies that can be used, but I would prefer to use the basic principles of inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.
